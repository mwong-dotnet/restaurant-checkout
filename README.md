# Restaurant Till

## Specification

You are building a checkout system for a restaurant which only sells Starters and Mains

Starters cost £4.40, Mains cost £7.00 each

1. Build a checkout system that takes a list of items at the till and outputs the total cost

2. You can Add/Update/Delete Items in shopping cart

3. Build a set of automated tests to test your checkout system

I do not expect any user interface components to be developed for this task, just business objects and unit tests using a testing framework of your choice
